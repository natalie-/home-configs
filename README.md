# Config files for the lazy home admin

Mostly I'm just tired of configuring individual Raspberry Pi machines each time I want to start a new project or tinker a bit.  Also, documenting it makes life a little easier.

# Machines
- Media Pi:  A Raspberry Pi model 2 that runs Kodi (on Arch Linux) and has a big drive hooked up for movies and such.
- Pi Hole:  [This](https://pi-hole.net) awesome project on a a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian blocks ads by being a DNS server.  This machine also hosts the DHCP server and later, a SaltStack master.
- My desktop:  Fedora 26.
